*N.B. Originally, this was my showcase project when I was looking for Android developer position. Then after I started working with MTS Digital, I ceased to update this project and it become significantly outdated. Now I'm returning to it as I feel it does not reflect the level of my skills anymore.Â :) Yet please bear in mind that I have but very limited amount of personal time to dedicate to this project, so you still can find a lot of outdated and wierd code here which I have not had a chance to get my hands on*

## Project Description
